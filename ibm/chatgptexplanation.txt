This question seems to deal with exclusive execution times of functions in a preemptive single-threaded CPU based on the task's execution log.

In simpler terms:

    You have n functions.
    Each function can be preempted by other functions, and you need to calculate how much exclusive time each function gets.
    The execution log (logs) will tell when a function starts and ends. These logs help track when each function starts or is preempted.

Key Points:

    Exclusive time: The time when the function is actively running, not when it's preempted by another higher-priority task.
    Logs will be in the form:
        "function_id:start:timestamp"
        "function_id:end:timestamp"

Solution Strategy:

    Parse the log entries.
    Use a stack to keep track of currently running functions.
    Track each function's exclusive time.
    Whenever a function is preempted or resumed, adjust the times accordingly.

Hereâ€™s a C++ solution that follows this approach:
C++ Code:

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <stack>
#include <sstream>

using namespace std;

vector<int> exclusiveTime(int n, vector<string>& logs) {
    vector<int> result(n, 0);  // To store the exclusive time for each function
    stack<int> functionStack;  // Stack to store active function IDs
    int prevTime = 0;          // To track the previous timestamp
    
    for (const string& log : logs) {
        // Split the log into parts (function_id, start/end, timestamp)
        stringstream ss(log);
        string idStr, type, timeStr;
        getline(ss, idStr, ':');
        getline(ss, type, ':');
        getline(ss, timeStr, ':');
        
        int id = stoi(idStr);  // Function ID
        int timestamp = stoi(timeStr);  // Time
        
        if (!functionStack.empty()) {
            // Add time spent by the top function in the stack
            result[functionStack.top()] += (timestamp - prevTime);
        }
        
        prevTime = timestamp;  // Update previous time
        
        if (type == "start") {
            // Function starts, push onto stack
            functionStack.push(id);
        } else {
            // Function ends, pop from stack and account for its time
            result[functionStack.top()] += 1;  // Include the current second
            functionStack.pop();
            prevTime++;  // Move time ahead after the end
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    int n = 2;  // Number of functions
    vector<string> logs = {
        "0:start:0",
        "1:start:2",
        "1:end:5",
        "0:end:6"
    };

    vector<int> result = exclusiveTime(n, logs);
    
    for (int time : result) {
        cout << time << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}

Explanation:

    Logs parsing: The log entries are split into three parts: function ID, type (start/end), and timestamp.
    Stack-based approach: We use a stack to track the currently running function. When a new function starts, the previous one is paused, and we push the new function onto the stack. When a function ends, it pops from the stack.
    Exclusive time calculation:
        For each function start, we update the time for the previous function (if any) and start tracking the new function.
        For each function end, we update the function's time and pop it off the stack.
    Adjusting time: After a function ends, we move the time forward by one (prevTime++) because the end event includes that time.

Example:

For the input logs:

makefile

0:start:0
1:start:2
1:end:5
0:end:6

The result will be:

csharp

[3, 4]

    Function 0 runs from 0-1, pauses, and resumes from 6-6 (total 3 units of time).
    Function 1 runs exclusively from 2-5 (total 4 units of time).

Edge Cases:

    Only one function (no preemption).
    Overlapping starts and ends.
